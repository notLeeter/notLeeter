### Projects
All projects are currently private!
- "The Arcade Machine"
  - A bot for the "Cosmic Arcade" discord server.
- psx
  - more info when it's ready ðŸ‘€
- Password-manager
  - ***Currently on hold***, as the name suggests, a password manager. Big project and currently no motivation to continue working on it. I'm not releasing it's cs untill I think it's at least somewhat secure and viable to be used. Will exist of a server install to host it yourself and some kind of application.
  
### Schedule
I currently don't have a schedule for working on projects nor for when I release commits (other then when they're ready) as I'm currently busy with school and work.
